### My Cybersecurity Journey

Hi, I'm **Eliel Monfort** — a recent Computer Science graduate passionate about cybersecurity, especially the offensive side. This site documents my journey from curious beginner to aspiring security professional, sharing everything I learn and achieve along the way.

---

### The Beginning

My path into IT started at age of 14 when I began university-level computer science courses alongside high school. What fascinated me wasn't just writing code — it was understanding how systems work, how they can be exploited, and most importantly, how to think like an attacker.

Fast forward to 2025: I've completed my B.Sc in Computer Science from Lev Academic Center, specializing in **Network Security, Reverse Engineering, Penetration Testing, and Red Teaming**.

### What I'm Doing Now?

I'm currently building hands-on expertise through:

**Continuous Learning** - Pursuing industry certifications and documenting my progress through blog posts, WriteUps, and study notes.

**CTF Challenges** - Actively solving security challenges on HackTheBox and TryHackMe and others similar platforms, sharpening my skills in vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and defensive techniques.

**Real-World Projects** - From leading hackathon teams to building multi-layered CTF platforms, I focus on practical application of security concepts.
