# Penetration Testing Methodology

A systematic methodology ensures thorough and consistent penetration testing while maintaining ethical standards and maximizing value for the organization.

## Standard Methodology Frameworks

### OWASP Testing Guide

Comprehensive methodology for web application security testing.

### NIST SP 800-115

Technical guide to information security testing and assessment.

### OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)

Peer-reviewed methodology for security testing.

## Testing Phases

### 1. Pre-Engagement

- Define scope and objectives
- Obtain proper authorization
- Sign legal agreements
- Establish communication protocols

### 2. Information Gathering

- **Passive Reconnaissance**: Gathering information without direct interaction
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Direct interaction with target systems
- **OSINT**: Open Source Intelligence gathering

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment

- Automated scanning
- Manual verification
- Vulnerability prioritization
- False positive elimination

### 4. Exploitation

- Proof of concept development
- Exploitation attempts
- Privilege escalation
- Lateral movement

### 5. Post-Exploitation

- Data collection
- Persistence establishment
- Impact assessment
- Evidence gathering

### 6. Reporting

- Executive summary
- Technical findings
- Risk assessment
- Remediation recommendations

## Best Practices

- Always obtain written authorization
- Maintain detailed documentation
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Minimize system impact
- Protect confidential information
